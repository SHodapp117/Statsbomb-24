This is work I have done for the Statsbomb 2024 confrence in England 

The working title is "Examining changes in underlying probabilities brought on by changes in feild players in competative game states"

Running thoughts
We are trying to answer the following question
Tactical trade-offs: under what conditions is it better to attempt action A over action B? 


Game state changes from subs
	-Underlying X(x) numbers 
	-Delta on chance creation, passing, shooting, etc
	-shape @ team level ie touch map and other positional preformance determinites
	{Subs are not evenly distributed} +/- 5 minute window evaluation 
-timing of substitutions [edge cases]
